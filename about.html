    <h3>About Us: </h3>
    <p>"Like the cobra our websites are meant to be sleek, stealthy, fast and quiet. Most importantly they are meant to be fearsome.</p> 
    
    <p>That means we take the ultimate care in providing you the tools to build your site to the lofty standards we lay out even our very own site. No, you do not need to be a pro to utilize your site to its full potential. Our tools and free classroom tutorials will help you get the most out of your tier.‚Äù</p>

    <p>We founded our company in the year of 2021, with web technology maturing we took it upon ourselves to offer a superior tech stack counter against our competitors.</p>

    <p>The Pit and it's symbol of the Cobra felt it was an adequete way to seperate us from the cut-of-the-mill CMS' on the market today.</p>

    <p>The question is, do you have what it takes to seperate yourself from the rest like a Cobra does?</p>
