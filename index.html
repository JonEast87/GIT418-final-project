    <h2>Tutorial - Intermediate JavaScript Functions</h2>
    <p class="italic">Author: Jonathan Eastin

    </p>
    <p>I want to talk a little about intermediate and advanced functions built into the JavaScript language. Most students are aware of the more rudimentary loops such as, "for", "do while" and "while".</p>
    <p>However there exists more than just those, and in several cases they are superior at certain tasks than the others.</p>
    <p>I am going to begin with the filter function call. Say I wanted to only have only numbers less than five taken from one array and put into another?</p>
    <p>Well you would probably start that solution off like:</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="javascript">
        const lessThanFive = new Array()
        for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
          if (array[i] < 5) {
            lessThanFive.push(array[i])
          }
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Seems simple right? Well there is a better and quicker way to accomplish.</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="javascript">
        const lessThanFive = numbers.filter(number => number < 5)
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>You might be wondering, "That's it?", "No setting up the array length? No instantiating of i or any other vowel to track the loop's progress?"</p>
    <p>Nope none of that. In fact the filter method can be used in many ways not just for sifting numbers, but word lengths and element types.</p>
    <p>These functions are referred to as "Higher Order Functions". There are several of them and they are all specialized to handle certain tasks.</p>
    <p>Let's look at another intermediate function call in JavaScript. My personal favorite, "map".</p>
    <p>If you wanted to double the values of each array's elements you could do something similar to this:</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="javascript">
        const array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
        const doubled = new Array()
        for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
          doubled.push(2 * array[i])
        }
      </code> 
    </pre>
    <p>Instead with map we can do that in just two lines:</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="javascript">
        const array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
        const doubled = array.map(x => x * 2)
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>It's magnificent isn't it? Now while these solutions are not anymore efficent than the others in terms of time execution they do save lines and make your code much more manageable.</p>
    <p>Also to note, is that since they are technically functions they can also be tied to const and let variables for ease of use or reuse, whereas having to do the same for a standard for loop would require more typing. With these intermediate functions, they are already built.</p>
    <p>These methods asbstract a lot of the setup away but there are still numerous ways for you to have more immediate control of them, let's look at the 'forEach' function for this case:</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="javascript">
        const array = [5, 4, 5]
        const iterationVariable = array.forEach(element => element + element)
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Following the forEach call is what is referred to as a <span class="underline">callback</span>, this callback contains the <span class="underline">'element'</span> which is the current item being processed in the array, an <span class="underline">'index'</span> which is it's spot in the array, and then the array itself that is being looped through.</p>
    <p>The variable above however will return an 'undefined' value. Why? This is because forEach unlike 'map' or 'filter' simply loops through the array without doing any mutations to the array that it is called on. You can get a return value and have it change or mutate if you want:</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="javascript">
        const iterationFunction = array => {
          let sum = []
          array.forEach(element => double.push(element + element))
          return sum
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>The above call tells the forEach that you want it to 'push' the added elements into the new variable 'double' and the function itself will return it when done.</p>
    <p>Because of how the forEach is setup it actually gives you more control on what you can do with it and return as a result of it.</p>
